----------------------
Car <-> Server <-> App
----------------------

After discarding CR+LF line termination, and base64 decoding, the following protocol messages are defined.

  <message> ::= <magic> <version> <space> <protmsg>

  <magic> ::= MP-

  <version> ::= 1 byte version number - this protocol is 0x30 <space> ::= ' ' (ascii 0x20)

  <protmsg> ::= <servertocar> | <cartoserver> | <servertoapp> | <apptoserver>

  <servertocar> ::- "S" <payload>

  <cartoserver> ::= "C" <payload>

  <servertoapp> ::= "s" <payload>

  <apptoserver> ::= "c" <payload>

  <payload> ::= <code> <data>

  <code> ::= 1 byte instruction code

  <data> ::= N bytes data (dependent on instruction code)

---------------------
Ping message 0x41 "A"
---------------------

This message may be sent by any party, to test the link. The expected response is a 0x61 ping acknowledgement. There is no expected payload to this message, an any given can be discarded.

-------------------------------------
Ping Acknowledgement message 0x61 "a"
-------------------------------------

This message is sent in response to a 0x41 ping message. There is no expected payload to this message, an any given can be discarded.

------------------------
Command message 0x43 "C"
------------------------

This message is sent <apptoserver> then <servertocar> and carries a command to be executed on the car. The message would normally be paranoid-encrypted.

<data> is a comma-separated list of:

* command (a command code 0..65535)
* parameters (dependent on the command code)

For further information on command codes and parameters, see the command section below.

-------------------------
Command response 0x63 "c"
-------------------------

This message is sent <cartoserver> then <servertoapp> and carries the response to a command executed on the car. The message would normally be paranoid-encrypted.

<data> is a comma-separated list of:

* command (a command code 0..65535)
* result (0=ok, 1=failed, 2=unsupported, 3=unimplemented)
* parameters (dependent on the command code and result)

For result=0, the parameters depend on the command being responded to (see the command section below for further information).

For result=1, the parameter is a textual string describing the fault.

For result=2 or 3, the parameter is not used.

--------------------------------
Car Environment message 0x44 "D"

----------------------------------------
Paranoid-mode encrypted message 0x45 "E" 
----------------------------------------
This message is sent for any of the four message <protmsg> types, and represents an encrypted transmission that the server should just relay (or is relaying) without being able to interpret it. The encryption is based on a shared secret, between the car and the apps, to which the server is not privy.

<data> is:

* <paranoidtoken> | <paranoidcode>
* <paranoidtoken> ::= "T" <ptoken>
* <paranoidcode> ::= "M" <code> <data>

In the case of <paranoidtoken>, the <ptoken> is a random token that represent the encryption key. It can only be sent <cartoserver> or <servertoapp>. Upon receiving this token, the server discards all previously stored paranoid messages, sends it on to all connected apps, and then stores the token. Every time an app connects, the server also sends this token to the app.

In the case of <paranoidcode>, the <code> is a sub-message code, and can be any of the codes listed in this document (except for "A", "a" and "E"). The <data> is the corresponding encrypted payload message. The encryption is performed on the <data> by:

* Create a new hmac-md5 based on the <ptoken>, with the shared secret.
* Use the new hmac digest as the key for symmetric rc4 encryption.
* Generate, and discard, 1024 bytes of cipher text.

and the data is base64 encoded. Upon receiving a paranoid message from the car, the server forwards it on the all connected apps, and then stores the message. Every time an app connects, the server sends all such stored messages. Upon receiving a paranoid message from an app, if the car is connected, the server merely forwards it on to the car, otherwise discarding it.

-----------------------------
Car firmware message 0x46 "F"

* Car type (TR=Tesla Roadster, others may follow)
* GSM lock

--------------------------------

---------------------------------------
Historical Data update message 0x48 "H"
---------------------------------------

This message is sent <cartoserver> "C, and transmits a historical data message for storage on the server.

<data> is comma-separated list of:

* type (unique storage class identification type)
* recordnumber (integer record number)
* lifetime (in seconds)
* data (a blob of data to be dealt with as the application requires)

The lifetime is specified in seconds, and indicates to the server the minimum time the vehicle expects the
server to retain the historical data for. Consideration should be made as to server storage and bandwidth requirements.

The type is composed of <vehicletype> - <class> - <property>

<Vehicletype> is the usual vehicle type, or '*' to indicate generic storage suitable for all vehicles.

<Class> is one of:

* PWR (power)
* ENG (engine)
* TRX (transmission)
* CHS (chassis)
* BDY (body)
* ELC (electrics)
* SAF (safety)
* SEC (security)
* CMF (comfort)
* ENT (entertainment)
* COM (communications)
* X** (unclassified and experimental, with ** replaced with 2 digits code)

<Property> is a property code, which the vehicle decides.

The server will timestamp the incoming historical records, and will set an expiry date of timestamp + <lifetime> seconds. The server will endeavor to retain the records for that time period, but may expend data earlier if necessary.

-------------------------------------------
Historical Data update+ack message 0x68 "h"
-------------------------------------------

This message is sent <cartoserver> "C", or <severtocar> "c", and transmits/acknowledges historical data message for storage on the server.

For <cartoserver>, the <data> is comma-separated list of:

* ackcode (an acknowledgement code)
* timediff (in seconds)
* type (unique storage class identification type)
* recordnumber (integer record number)
* lifetime (in seconds)
* data (a blob of data to be dealt with as the application requires)

The ackcode is a numeric acknowledgement code - if the server successfully receives the message, it will reply with "h" and this ackcode to acknowledge reception.

The timediff is the time difference, in seconds, to use when storing the record (e.g.; -3600 would indicate the record data is from one hour ago).

The lifetime is specified in seconds, and indicates to the server the minimum time the vehicle expects the server to retain
the historical data for. Consideration should be made as to server storage and bandwidth requirements.

For <servertocar>, the <data> is:

* ackcode (an acknowledgement code)

The <cartoserver> message sends the data to the server. The <servertocar> message acknowledges the data.

----------------------------------
Push notification message 0x50 "P"
----------------------------------

This message is sent <cartoserver> "C", or <servertoapp> "s". When used by the car, it requests the server to send a textual push notification alert message to all apps registered for this car. The <data> is 1 byte alert type followed by N bytes of textual message. The server will use this message to send the notification to any connected apps, and can also send via external mobile frameworks for unconnected apps.

---------------------------------------
Push notification subscription 0x70 "p"
---------------------------------------

This message is sent <apptoserver> A". It is used by app to register for push notifications, and is normally at the start of a connection. The <data> is made up of:

<appid>,<pushtype>,<pushkeytype>,<vehicleid>,<netpass>,<pushkeyvalue>

The server will verify the credentials for each vehicle, and store the required notification information.

Note: As of June 2020, only one vehicleid can be subscribed at a time. If multiple vehicles are
required, then they should each be subscribed in individual messages.
